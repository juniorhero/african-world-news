<p>Why do Canadians live longer than Americans?</p>
<p><em>From BBC World Service</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canadians are outliving Americans, in some cases, by as much as a decade. Is public healthcare the secret to longevity?</p>
<p>When Erick Bauer was first diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) as an infant, his parents were told he'd be lucky to make it to his 20th birthday.</p>
<p>Now turning 32 and expecting his first child, Mr Bauer attributes his relatively good health to the close relationship he has with his medical team at St Michael's Hospital in Toronto, which he says helps him maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.</p>
<p>He takes about 60 pills a day to help control the hereditary disease, which can affect the lungs, pancreas and gastro-intestinal tract.</p>
<p>"For all those younger CF patients who live with the disease right now, it is really important to just keep searching for that cure or that control for that disease," he told the BBC. "That is my hope for the future."</p>
<p>Life expectancy for cystic fibrosis patients has increased much faster in Canada than it has in the US, a new study published this month in the Annals of Internal Medicine found.</p>
<p>Canadians living with cystic fibrosis lived on average 10 years longer than Americans with the same disease, in part because of the very different healthcare systems in the two countries, the study found.</p>
<p>Why do Americans die younger than Britons?</p>
<p>When severity of disease, age and other variables were taken into account, Canadians had a 34% lower death rate than American patients overall.</p>
<p>US patients with private insurance had a similar life expectancy as their Canadian counterparts, whereas Canadians had a 44% lower death rate than Americans on Medicaid. The uninsured fared the worst - Canadians had a 77% lower death rate than Americans who had no insurance at all.</p>
<p>Why is Obamacare so controversial?</p>
<p>How does US welfare compare?</p>
<p>"I think there may be some sort of inherent differences in the systems themselves, but teasing it out is hard," says Dr Anne Stephenson, lead author of the study and a researcher at St Michael's Hospital.</p>
<p>Erick Bauer sits in waiting room</p>
<p>Image caption</p>
<p>When Erick Bauer, 32, was born, a patient with cystic fibrosis was only expected to live until 17. Now, Canadian patients have a median expectancy of 51 years</p>
<p>The results of the study did not come as a surprise to Michelle Brotherwood, a registered dietician who spent years working with children with cystic fibrosis in Canada and the US.</p>
<p>Ms Brotherwood spent three years working in a cystic fibrosis clinic in Los Angeles, after working at Dr Stephenson's clinic in Toronto.</p>
<p>The differences, she says, were striking.</p>
<p>"In Canada, I make clinical decisions. I look at their case and I decide whether or not they would benefit from meeting with me. There, the decision is driven by their insurance," she says.</p>
<p>Ms Brotherwood says she had to forgo seeing patients who were in real need, just because they did not have the coverage.</p>
<p>Sometimes, she'd consult with patients who were thriving and did not necessarily need a dietician, simply because their plan covered it.</p>
<p>Even when they were insured, high co-pays meant that some families had to reduce the amount of medication they used, or avoid going to the hospital, she says.</p>
<p>Many researchers have suggested that this profit motive, and the strain it puts on families, may be to blame for the average lower life expectancy in the US.</p>
<p>Although the decade-long Canadian advantage seen in cystic fibrosis study is striking, numerous studies have shown that Canadians tend to outlive their American counterparts.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Canadians live almost three years longer than Americans overall.</p>
<p>This difference can be observed in a variety of diseases.</p>
<p>Dr PJ Devereaux, a researcher at McMaster University, says that studies of patients with end-stage renal failure show that Canadians live longer than Americans because the quality of care is better. He says for-profit health clinics in the US spend more on marketing, and less on qualified staff.</p>
<p>"You do not have to be a healthcare expert to recognise that a huge determinate of how you or your loved one will do depends on the quality" of healthcare providers, Dr Devereaux says.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JJ Whicker&rsquo;s son was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis shortly after being born</p>
<p>But Erin Strumpf, who researches public health at McGill University in Montreal, says it is not so simple.</p>
<p>With so many factors affecting health, such as lifestyle and genetics, it can be difficult to draw broad conclusions about why Canadians live longer. Rates of obesity and smoking, and socioeconomic factors may all impact the different outcomes we see in the US.</p>
<p>"People like the explanation of universal health coverage; people like the explanation of more redistributive social programmes," she says.</p>
<p>"But it is a challenging thing, to really understand what causes those differences."</p>
<p>A 2007 joint-study between the Centre of Disease Control and Statistics Canada found that health outcomes were fairly similar between both countries, with most citizens reporting good health. However, Americans with the lowest income were more likely to report health problems than Canadians (31% v 23%), and when Americans complained of unmet health needs, they were more likely to cite cost as a reason. Canadians were more likely to cite waiting times.</p>
<p>For Ms Brotherwood, the move back to Canada has been a relief, not because the doctors in Los Angeles were anything but excellent, but because she says she grew tired of spending so much energy fighting with insurance companies, instead of providing care.</p>
<p>"Kids would say to me, or teenagers or young adults, 'My family is bankrupt because of my cystic fibrosis,'" she says.</p>
<p>That is something JJ Whicker hopes his son, who was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis shortly after being born last year, will never have to face.</p>
<p>A graduate student in Utah, Mr Whicker was concerned he'd have to quit school.</p>
<p>But he has been relieved to find that Medicaid covers almost all of his son's needs.</p>
<p>As the US government weighs changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicaid, he says he is worried about what the future will hold for families like his who rely on federal programmes to save their children's lives.</p>
<p>"It is something I think about often," he says.</p>

<p>Anit-apartheid icon Kathrada dies</p>
<p>Anti-apartheid activist Ahmed Kathrada, who spent 26 years in jail &ndash; many of them alongside Nelson Mandela&nbsp; &ndash; for acts of sabotage against South Africa's white minority government, died in Johannesburg on Tuesday morning at the age of 87.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had been admitted to hospital with blood clotting in his brain earlier this month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kathrada was born on August 21, 1929, to Indian immigrant parents in a small town in northwestern South Africa .</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/update/news1.jpg"></p>
<p>He was among those tried and jailed alongside Mandela in the Rivonia trial in 1964, which drew worldwide attention and highlighted the brutal legal system under the apartheid regime.Kathrada was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 and spent 26 years and three months in prison, 18 of which were on Robben Island.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the end of apartheid, he served from 1994 and 1999 as parliamentary counsellor to President Mandela in the first African National Congress (ANC) government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diplomats say it's a sad day in South Africa &ndash; where Kathrada was affectionately known as "Uncle Kathy" &ndash; as tributes poured in about his widely perceived kindness, humility, and honesty.</p>
<p>He had been a major part of many South African's memories over decades of anti-apartheid struggle, Page said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I think his passing is sort of signalling to South Africans, yet again, the ending of an era, of these great giants of apartheid [resistance] as they pass on," she added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kathrada gave an emotional speech at Mandela's funeral, in which he said he had lost a brother.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kathrada was, until recently, still active in public life. He formed his own foundation and advocated strongly for human rights causes such as youth development, anti-racism, and freedom of speech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, he joined a movement of veteran figures who were critical of the governing ANC and its current crop of leaders - particularly President Jacob Zuma , who has been mired in mounting allegations of corruption . Kathrada penned an open letter to the president and called on him to step down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Right to the very end he kept himself relevant, he was a newsmaker, he was honest and true to his values and his beliefs," Page said. "And that's why so many millions of South Africans will be very sad at his passing today."</p>
<p>"This is a great loss to the ANC, the broader liberation movement and South Africa as a whole," Neeshan Balton, head of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, said in a statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"'Kathy' was an inspiration to millions in different parts of the world."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kathrada's activism against the white-minority apartheid regime started at the age of 17, when he was one of 2,000 "passive resisters" arrested in 1946 for defying a law that discriminated against Indian South Africans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July 1963, the police swooped on Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia, a Johannesburg suburb where Kathrada and other senior activists had been meeting in secret.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the famous Rivonia trial, eight of the accused were sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labour on Robben Island.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His fellow prisoners included Mandela, Walter Sisulu and Denis Goldberg.</p>

<p>Analysis: What next for Africa after Brexit?</p>
<p>By John Kotsopoulos, University of Pretoria, South Africa</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The signing of the Treaty of Rome, which established the European Economic Community (EEC) 60 years ago in March 1957, came at a tumultuous time in relations between Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just weeks earlier Kwame Nkrumah had declared Ghana a republic, an event which was a turning point in the decolonisation of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nkrumah remarked that the treaty's inclusion of colonial territories was to neocolonialism what the Berlin Treaty of 1885 had been to colonialism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had a point. Two of the six founding members of the EEC - Belgium and France - still held substantial colonial interests on the continent. Accession to the community thus posed the crucial question of what to do about them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question became contentious enough to threaten the collapse of the entire Treaty of Rome negotiation process. The other four members of the EEC were Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>France in particular was steadfast that its colonies be "associated" with the community. Paris envisaged that its preferential colonial terms of trade would be extended to the entire EEC. But Germany and the Netherlands were opposed, wary of being forced to share the financial and political responsibilities that came with trading with former colonies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The French argument ultimately won, albeit with some compromises. The treaty's association agreement would last five years and the preferences France enjoyed from its colonies would be gradually expanded to the rest of the EEC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agreement, inscribed into articles 131-136 of the treaty, served as the originator of Europe's subsequent relationship with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP). This was codified in the Yaound&eacute; Agreements, the Lom&eacute; Convention and today's Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this 60th anniversary is not just about Europe. The treaty created a framework for multilateral relations between Europe and Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The principles of trade and aid enshrined in the treaty's association agreement form the basis of Europe's development agenda in Africa to this day, even though relations have expanded into many more areas in the 21st century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A common future</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Treaty of Rome laid out the blueprint for the creation of the world's largest single market. It also contributed to the post World War II process of cooperation and reconciliation in Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The push for European unity persisted for 37 years, culminating in the creation of the European Union (EU) under the Maastricht Treaty in 1993.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although difficult to imagine amid the doom and gloom of Brexit, rising populism and the migration crisis, there is still reason to celebrate when you consider the region's relationship with Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU, for all of its troubles, has generally been a progressive partner to Africa, especially with respect to the establishment of the Joint Africa-EU Strategy and the unique programming efforts it has generated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This of course does not negate instances of neocolonialism, nor the damage done by the clumsy promotion of the European Partnership Agreements (EPAs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EPAs in particular remain a sore point. Indeed, the preferential trade terms given to African countries by EU member states have been judged discriminatory and in contravention of World Trade Organisation rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>She's 'The Boss' when it comes to the red carpet, and we love to 'Spy' on her style selections. Bringing 'The Heat' to the world of fashion, it's ...</p>
<p>Beyond the EPA debate, a number of factors have contributed to challenges facing some of the original asymmetries between the two sides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one, the global South, and China in particular, continues to alter global trade dynamics. African countries and regional organisations now have more trading partners to turn to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Africa is in the middle of constructive upheaval, brought on by more than 20 years of robust growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Africa of today is not the Africa of 1957. The African Union is also a more robust partner than its predecessor, the Organisation of Africa Unity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in 1957, the Treaty of Rome laid down the twin principles of EU-Africa relations throughout the 20th century and beyond: trade and aid. These principles were framed within the larger idea of development cooperation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The association agreement provided reciprocal trading arrangements between 31 'overseas territories' - including 18 African ones - and the ECC countries. An overseas development fund was also created, with all six EEC members contributing to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Controversially, the agreement served to perpetuate African dependency on Europe. Even the Lome Convention's much touted "non-reciprocal" principle, which was supposed to nurture African industries, further attached them to Europe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The convention eventually met strong criticism as a system of "collective clientelism", which was perpetuating dependency and "elite capture" in Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This contradictory relationship between dependency and progressive thinking has made Africans understandably circumspect.</p>
<p>The twin principles of trade and aid still exist. But the growth of the EU-Africa partnership since 2000 - outside of EU-ACP channels - has broadened the relationship into less traditional areas such as science and technology, higher education, private investment, infrastructure and continental integration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Kwame Nkurumah's 1957 criticism is still being levied at the EU today for its alleged neocolonial promotion of the EPAs. Pundits in East and Central Africa have been vociferous in their opposition to the agreements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, EU officials have a dramatically different interpretation. The EU Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development, Neven Mimica, described the 2016 EPA with six Southern African Development Community (SADC) members as helping to tap the economic potential of the private sector and increase trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With such contrasting perceptions, it is perhaps unsurprising that SADC is the only regional body to have signed an EPA with the EU despite more than 10 years of negotiation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is crucial is that both sides recognise how far they have come since the Treaty of Rome. And that they accept that a more equitable partnership requires continued commitment to cooperation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Statue of Pharoah Ramsey 2 unearth in Egypt</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Egypt is known as the land of Pharaohs. Years after the reign of Pharaohs, archaeologists are trying to find more and more remains and evidences of this past world. A statue believed to depict Pharaoh Ramses II has been excavated, an important relic, which could help spur the country's tourism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 26ft (6 metre) statue has been discovered by Egyptian and German archaeologists near the ruins of Ramses II temple. The 3,000 year old statue was lifted with cranes in the ancient city of Heliopolis in what has been described as a great moment for archaeology. Alongside the statue believed to depict Ramses II, they also found a limestone statue of Pharaoh Seti II, Ramse's II grandson.</p>
<p>According to the BBC, the relics were found in the north-east of Cairo, close to the temple of Ramses II, also known as Ramses the Great, and experts believe it may represent Ramses II. Ramses the Great was the most powerful and celebrated ruler of ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is believed he extended the power of Egypt all the way to Syria and Sudan. He ruled between 1279 to 1213BCE.</p>
<p>The torso of the statue was hauled out from deep muddy groundwater using a crane and bulldozer. Last week Thursday, the giant head of the statue was excavated. These excavations are likely to boost Egypt's tourism sector which suffered set back after the Egyptian revolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ministry of Antiquities said the statue's parts would be moved and assembled at the Egyptian museum in central Cairo. It's hoped that it will be possible to put the two large pieces together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once put together and analysed, the two pieces will be moved to the Grand Egyptian museum near the Giza Pyramids, which will open next year. The statue is reportedly made out of quartzite.</p>
<p>The statue was submerged in ground water in a Cairo slum. Many of the residents cheered as the statue was lifted. Residents could be seen taking selfies with the statue. Present during the excavation were the Egyptian Minister of Antiquities, Khaled el-Anani, German ambassador to Egypt Julius Georg Luy. The University of Leipzig and the Ministry of Antiquity in Egypt had a joint effort in the project. The University of Leipzig has been working in ancient Heliopolis, where the statue was found, for more than a decade.</p>

<p><strong>Do Canadian laws hamper African immigrants&rsquo; parent-to-child upbringing ?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Peter Uduehi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Toronto recently, police reported the death of Aloy Onochie. He died during fisticuffs with his teenage son Uchenna Onochie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But many in the Nigerian community are livid; not because the 61-year-old father is no more, but because of the way he died: killed in a blow by blow physical fight with a child he birthed. To many Africans, this incident is simply an abomination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asked what to make of the incident, Daniel Isesele, president of a Esan United in Canada, a Nigerian tribal grouping whose business is to cater for members&rsquo; well-being, &ldquo;this is unbecoming of our culture, but you have to understand why this type of incident occurs&rdquo;, noting &ldquo;it is part of a system which does not allow parents to instil the fear of parental guidance in children. In Africa we mete out corporal punishment to our kids when they do wrong but you cannot do that in Canada where it is considered abuse&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;Children grow up having the utmost respect for their parents as not only are they under the guidance of their blood parents but also under the watchful eyes of the entire elder community,&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though details of the relationship between the senior and junior Onochies are not known, it is known that Uchenna lived with his father Aloy, police said. However, Isesele is ready to wager that the teenager, because he was born in Canada, has little knowledge of African traditions. That may have been Aloy&rsquo;s Achilles&rsquo; heel&rdquo;, he said.</p>

<p><strong><br /></strong><strong>Anti-radicalisation Toronto Somalis nipping Jihadists&rsquo; influence in the bud</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Peter Uduehi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot pretend that our children in Canada could not be influenced by these crazy people who call themselves Muslims. We are aware of how terrorist groups like Al-Shabaab and ISIS have poisoned the minds of innocent Somali and other African youths everywhere they can find them,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the summation Jibril Muhammed, Somali community activist in Toronto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He told the African World News he is fed up of reports relating to stories and events of how Jihadist terrorists have successfully recruited African youths in the US state of Minnesota, Kenya and several European countries, noting: &ldquo;we cannot pretend that our children in Canada could not be influenced by the Jihadists who are nothing but fake Muslims as far as he is concerned. &ldquo;We know who the real Muslims are and we must root them out,&rdquo; he said, adding that many members of the Somali community in Canada are good people who are on the lookout for the terrorist-minded people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muhammed said the RCMP, parliamentarians and the police are aware of the community&rsquo;s efforts to rein in these Jihadists if they exist among us, &ldquo;but first we have to protect our children against these bad eggs, every one of us&hellip;as kids can be easily influenced through peer pressure. We have to watch the type of media our children are listening to and watching&rdquo;, he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agrees another activist, Mohammed Abdi: &ldquo;Canada has been good to us and any terrorist trying to harm this country has no chance to use our kids against it. On my part, I am constantly educating my teenage children about what is the right Islam&rdquo;, he explains, stressing &ldquo;I tell them always that the ISIS and Boko Haram and Al-Shabab people they see on television are practising the wrong Islam&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are Africans in Canada changing their diet to their own detriment?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Peter Uduehi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many experts are of the opinion that African immigrants who change their traditional diet after a few years of arriving in Canada tend to become less healthy later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To buttress that point, a recent report by Statistics Canada finds two studies pointing in the same direction for most newly arrived immigrants to Canada. Overall, the studies show, newly arrived immigrants to Canada had lower mortality rates than the Canadian-born, and also reported lower levels of fair or poor health. Those mortality rates tended to rise the further removed immigrants were from their arrival in Canada, as were the reported levels of fair or poor health. Data from surveys of immigrants showed in fact that those who had been in the country for 10 years or longer reported being less healthy than residents born in Canada.</p>

<p>Tanzanian-born Toronto resident Dr. Wasira Bokore, a family physician, says generally the African immigrant succumbs to &ldquo;a new environment where time is limited for cooking your meals and begins to adopt new eating habits, eating burgers, fast foods and fatty foods and these things are not good for your health&rdquo;, adding that matters are made worse when &ldquo;an exercise regimen is absent in one&rsquo;s daily existence&rdquo;. He said immigrating to a new country can have a deleterious effect on one&rsquo;s health if &ldquo;you lose focus&rdquo;, adding that life in the Western world is &ldquo;markedly different from that in Africa where you are constantly without the same levels of comfort as you would find here&rdquo;, he said.</p>

<p><strong>African professionals making late inroads in Canada</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do Africans make late professional inroads in their respective career disciplines?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answers are legion but Nigerian-born Canadian resident Dr Adeleye King says the main reason is that many African do not do enough research about Canada to find out about the system before arriving its shores. &ldquo;If they did, they would know exactly the type of skills needed to survive with their professional know-how.&rdquo; He said it&rsquo;s important to plan ahead before immigrating and once here &ldquo;they should never lose concentration of why they are here, don&rsquo;t straddle your life between here and the one you just left&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr King, executive director of Canadian Institute of Leadership and Development (Africa), said when African professionals first come to the country as immigrants they are shocked to learn that they are being required to do more learning in their fields &ldquo;because Canada requires a different level of certification and designation from the ones in Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain professions like engineering, for example, require a designation before you can be accepted for work as an engineer. It&rsquo;s different in Africa where you are required only to be certified,&rdquo; he explained, noting, &ldquo;the same applies to other professions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>King said personal issues also play a role in preventing African professionals from making quick successes in the Canadian economy, adding that sometimes our priorities are not in order. &ldquo;Members of other immigrant groups start small when they first come to Canada&hellip;they manage in small apartments and save up enough money to either start a small business to tide them over or take their time to ready study the system, but in our case many of us want to start big when they enter a new country. That&rsquo;s not possible,&rdquo; he explained.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span > <span style="font-family: Tahoma, Geneva, sans-serif;">BY PETER UDUEHI<br /> Since the celebration of Black history month began 39 years ago in the US, a lot of emphasis has been placed particularly in the month of February on the mere semantics of what Black people have achieved as a cultural group in history, and especially in the history of the Americas. Not much, however, is being said of who Black people are as Africans and who Black people are as a people.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What I am trying to stress in the foregoing is that no one has been audacious enough to state in unequivocal terms &ldquo;who Black people really are&rdquo; in these February months; not only as a displaced people, but also as a once-enslaved and downtrodden people who deserve compensation and reparation for hundreds of years of institutionalised injustice and rapaciousness by established and discernable White institutions and governments from Europe to the Americas.<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anybody with a sense of history and good conscience must feel troubled that while other historically oppressed, vitiated and villified ethnic groups eventually received compensation or reparation for past injustices, Blacks in Europe and the Americas receive nothing. Survivors of the Holocaust recently received 60 million dollars from a French-US fund as compensation for Hitler&rsquo;s crimes against the Jewish people, not to mention billions of dollars meted out to thousands of Jews and the state of Israel by the Germans and other European institutions. The U.S. government did the same for thousands of interned innocent Japanese who were illegally incarcerated during the Second World War due to anger over Pearl Harbour. Various other ethnic groups who suffered humiliation from Australia to Canada have received compensation from governments. Why are Blacks in the Americas and Europe and Africa not receiving similar compensatory commitments? Don&rsquo;t Black lives really matter?<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Proponents of reparation are not pleading for handouts as they fervently believe the crimes must be atoned for; neither are they basing their demands on the fact that other wronged ethnic groups have been propitiated. The fact is American and European enslavement of Africans was a sin crying to heaven for vengeance. It surpassed the oppression suffered by others tenfold, dehumanising &nbsp;Black people for centuries. It continues to do so today as its weight still burdens all people of African descent even in these modern times. Those who want to wish away the calamitous effects of slavery must be reminded of the atrophy of Black civilisation; yet nary an American Congress has apologised for the scourge that slavery dealt. Some political smugs in the US and Europe naively argue that because the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade officially ended 120 years ago, Blacks must stop talking about it and just move on, dust themselves off, work harder and achieve like others; like Jews who too were persecuted. Yes, Jews were also persecuted throughout history, but those who committed crimes against their number were brought to book and their forebears paid (and continue to pay) financially for their sins. It is called reparation or compensation. And yes, many reparation activists believe that because Jews are a wealthy class everywhere, and because their financial clout have enormous influence on major aspects of western economies, no American or European power have had the temerity to ignore their demands for compensation. Add to that the fact that other wronged ethnic groups are not as visible a minority group as Blacks as objects of discrimination.<br /><br /><br /> A disappointing aspect to the reparation issue is the seeming silence of the current and first Black president of the US Barack Obama. His voice on the matter will make a difference; it should be indeed an agenda of his to make sure that an injustice is corrected. Maybe it will be the last jab he throws at the detractors as he leaves office. It will be a delight.<br /><br /><br /> For what reparation does is give the wronged a headstart. It emboldens them emotionally because someone was made to a pay a price. Police in America still brutalise Blacks in the streets because they don&rsquo;t respect Black lives. It&rsquo;s the direct result of a culture that grudgingly holds authority figures accountable in America when Black lives are violated. Black history month will continue to be a rant until Black people begin to challenge all countries whose forebears benefitted from their sweat and blood in growing their economies for more than 400 years.<br /></span></span></p>

The militant and terrorist Boko Haram group, an affiliate of Al Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for the abduction of the girls, boasting in a video released three weeks after the girls went missing that it will sell the girls who `they say &ldquo;should be married instead of being in school&rdquo;. To add more insult to injury the group carried out yet another bomb blast three weeks after the girls&rsquo; abduction killing 12 people; in the same place where the same atrocity&nbsp;was committed a mont</span></span>h earlier.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >Also called the &ldquo;Nigerian Taliban&rdquo;, imitating their gurus in Afghanistan, Boko Haram has been blamed for many criminal activities and atrocities in Nigeria. The group believes, as its name suggests, that &ldquo;Western education is immoral&rdquo; (or &ldquo;sinful&rdquo;). It seeks an Islamic state or caliphate in the country, totally oblivious to the fact that its manifesto is unachievable and ridiculous, says Joseph Odibo, president and founder of the anti-injustice organisation People Against Gangsterism, Terrorism and Corruption, an African movement based in Dublin, Ireland.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;The world is leaving them behind in all aspects of human development, Nigerians from the south are also leaving them behind and it is quite clear that the North&rsquo;s unserious approach to education because of a fanatical approach to religion will be their doom,&rdquo; Odibo stressed.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of the 57 million children not enrolled in elementary school worldwide, 10 million live in Northern Nigeria alone, according to the United Nations. The north of Nigeria is predominantly Muslim while the south is predominantly Christian and Africanist. The World Health Organisation has been grappling with the return of polio in Northern Nigeria because the leaders of various communities in that part of the country keep telling their people that Western medicine is out to drive a lethal blow into the blood of Muslims through vaccinations to prevent them from procreation and better health. Ironically it&rsquo;s a propaganda that is costing lives and improvement in the general wellbeing of millions of Northern Nigerians, hence the prevalence of polio there.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Religion, for many Northern Muslims, has replaced the once-thriving African culture that existed there before the advent of Islam from the Middle East,&rdquo; noted Fela, who as a popster for many years before his death in 1997 , used his music to challenge Africa&rsquo;s political leaders to good governance and a revival of the &ldquo;African Personality&rdquo; and African ideologies based on workable ancient practices of mutual respect and zero tolerance for dishonesty.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The ethnic groups of Northern Nigeria who converted to Islam are somehow different from their relatives in other parts of West Africa who embraced Islam but kept the essential aspects of their African heritage and culture intact. &ldquo;We Africans have our ideals and traditions too,&rdquo; Fela explains in the song BBC, indicating &ldquo;we have our rituals for teenagers growing into adulthood, we have our music, our literature, our art, our system of justice, marriage, land tenure, our dance and lifestyle, &rdquo; in the song Underground System.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Odibo says &ldquo;when you factor in the problems many in Northern Nigeria are facing in light of Boko Haram atrocities, the fact that education is still backward in that part of Nigeria compared to the south of the country which is predominantly Christian, and the almost disappearance of an African identity and culture among the people of the north, one can only conclude that Islam has been a curse rather than a blessing on the continent. And it&rsquo;s important to remember also that Nigeria is a huge country in Africa&hellip;it is one-fourth of the entire African continent,&rdquo; he added.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yet Nigeria is not the only nation where Islam&rsquo;s image is facing a public relations setback. In Mali, where some Muslim Tuareg invaders and insurgents from nearby Mauritania and North Africa made incursions into the West African country last year, libraries in the famous and ancient city of Timbuktu (renowned for its historical value to the Black race and centre of learning for being the site of the first university in the world) were burned and looted in the name of Allah, villagers were routed from their homes and told to replace their African literature and music with Muslim hymnals as they were instructed to cease adherence to their traditional way of life. Yet the people to whom they gave instructions in Mali were themselves good Muslims. Northern Mali, seized by the Muslim fanatics for months with a reign of terror lorded over its citizens, world-class musicians from the country &ndash; themselves avowed Muslims &ndash; started a campaign against the fanatics.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though the Muslim insurgents have since been flushed out of their positions by the combined forces of African, French and United Nations troops, virtuoso Malian guitarist Habib Koite told this reporter during a recent tour date to Toronto that &ldquo;these so-called Islamists who took over my country are not real Muslims. They call themselves Muslims but they are not practising Islam. Nowhere in Islam is it acceptable to kill anyone in the name of God. Nowhere does it say in Islam that you must disrespect anybody&rsquo;s culture. They are wasting their time anyway because nobody can tell an African not to play music. Music and being African are one and the same. I am a Muslim and I think I am a good Muslim but I am also an African musician; music keeps my people alive and no one can tell us not to do the things our forefathers have been doing for thousands and thousands of years, Islam or no Islam,&rdquo; Koite said.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It&rsquo;s a point echoed by fellow Malian singer Fatoumata Diawara who also spoke to this reporter last winter while touring Canada. &ldquo;How can you stop African people from dancing and playing music? It is not possible,&rdquo; she says, adding &ldquo;nothing, not even Islam can stop us or change that. I am a Muslim and these invaders don&rsquo;t know their bearing it seems. This is Africa. We have been playing music before Islam and Roman Catholism found their way into this continent.&rdquo;<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The invaders who call themselves Ansar Al-Dine are also Al Qaeda affiliates in the Maghreb (North Africa). They, like Al Shabbaz in Somalia, have vowed to fight another day. Meanwhile, Al-Shabbaz, flushed out of Somalia about the same period the Tuaregs were dealt with in Northern Mali, recently carried out a series of bombings in Kenya&rsquo;s port city of Mombasa killing scores of innocent people.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&ldquo;Christians in Africa don&rsquo;t do the things that some of our Muslim brothers do here, like go on suicide missions terrorizing everyone in the name of ideology and Jesus,&rdquo; notes Odibo. He went on: &ldquo;And although the average Muslim will tell you that the criminal elements among them carrying out these nefarious activities are simply criminals and have nothing to do with the religion, you don&rsquo;t feel any glaring outrage from their leaders&rdquo;.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Speaking in an interview in India last year, Nigerian and Nobel Literature Laureate Wole Soyinka said, in reference to Nigerian-born Detroit-Christmas underwear bomber Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab, that Islam is &ldquo;illogic&hellip;because none of the other religions preach apocalyptic violence&rdquo;.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Throughout Africa that illogic is festering as Christians, in the last two decades (in the case of Nigeria for over four decades now, considering the Maitatsine terrors and horrors of the 1970s - a period which recorded the start of overt hate crimes meted out on Christians by Muslims), continue to face mounting intolerance from their Muslim counterparts. Their churches are burned, members killed during church services and sometimes villages raised to the ground due to Islamist violence. The Nigerian-born football international Victor Moses, who plays for English Premiere League&rsquo;s Chelsea FC, lost both his parents (themselves Christian pastors) to the violence that erupted between Christians and Muslims in 2001 in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna. And South Sudan peoples (predominantly Christian), tired of discrimination and maltreatment from their northern neighbours (predominantly Muslim), decided to ask for independence and two years ago got their wish as one of the newest nations to join the United Nations. Meanwhile, a warrant for the arrest of Sudan president Omar Bashir is still being held up by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for crimes against humanity, mainly against the people of South Sudan. Sudan, before the secession of South Sudan, even ignored the composition and wishes of the latter and decided to become a member of the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC).<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;What kind of nerve do Muslims have?&rdquo; asks Odibo. &ldquo;How can you bring a pluralistic grouping under the umbrella of one monolithic group that speaks to the pride of only one member of your community? Where is that done? It is the height of disrespect to your community...so what the Muslims did were just utterly disrespectful,&rdquo; Odibo said.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Similar intolerance is experienced by Egyptian Coptics at the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood whose members have been known to burn churches and terrorize, harass and kill members of the Christian faith. In Central African Republic, many Muslims were sacked from an area in the capital Bangui recently following months of clashes between Christians and Muslims.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Matters came to a head in late 2012 when Muslim rebels, supported by Chadian and Sudanese fighters, quickly overran the country&rsquo;s army. Chad and Sudan are predominantly Muslim countries. After a series of peace deals with the opposition were not honoured, Muslim rebels invaded the capital and overthrew President Fran&ccedil;ois Boziz&eacute; last March and installed the country&rsquo;s first Muslim president, Michel Djotodia. Widespread human rights abuses by the Muslim rebels &mdash; such as the pillaging of neighborhoods, and the rape and killing of people &mdash; led to the creation of the anti-Balaka militias, mainly consisting of Christians and animists. The Christian militias attempted a coup early last December, with violence exploding between the two communities in the following days. The forced resignation of Djotodia last month, amid mounting international condemnation, emboldened the attacks of Christian militias on those it accuses of having cooperated with the government.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Jean-Bedel Bokassa, one of many sons of the late former Emperor of the Central African Republic, told this reporter &ldquo;this is probably the first time you are hearing about a &lsquo;Christian militia&rsquo; anywhere in the world standing up against Muslims or taking matters ito their own hands to stem the tide of Muslim terrorism before it grows wings. We usually hear of Muslim militias, because Christians and non-Muslims are just tired of folding their arms and not doing anything against the intolerance of Muslims. They have to do something, that&rsquo;s for sure,&rdquo; he said.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The prolonged and escalated violence of in CAR led to an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation at the body&rsquo;s headquarters in Saudi Arabia. The world&rsquo;s largest bloc of Islamic countries agreed to &ldquo;urgently dispatch&rdquo; a high-level mission to the capital, Bangui, to explore the situation, express solidarity with Muslims and contribute to any peace talks.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But the &ldquo;peace&rdquo; approach to conflicts has never been Islam&rsquo;s strong suit in Africa, where the Almoravids invaded the continent in medieval times to force conversion (same that Boko Haram was seen doing to their girl captors in a recent video); then an offshoot of an Arab militia rose in 1914 led by fundamentalist Usman dan Fodio who ran a campaign of Jihads across the Sahel only to be stopped in the Savannah on his way to the Atlantic coast of West Africa.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot really say Islam is the culprit here but the way some of our members have toyed with the religion in Africa or most parts of the world does not bode well for the religion in our continent, admits Diawara. &ldquo;I am a Muslim and I think to some extent Islam has been a curse to Africa when you see what African people are suffering because of it,&rdquo; she said, indicating that &ldquo;we must all stand up as good Muslims to fight the bad ones among us. Too often, the big Islamic countries just stand and look.&rdquo;<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For Fela, who probably summed it up best, &ldquo;peace and progress in Africa are only possible when foreign religions have been dealt an irresistible blow&rdquo;.<br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;"><span >&ldquo;With religion,&rdquo; the legendary musician told me in 1989 after his performance at the oldest lounge in New Orleans, The Tippitinnas Nightclub, &ldquo;comes the culture of the people you got it from. Westerners brought their religion to Africa during colonialism but they also brought with them fertilizers which poisoned and destroyed our crops and made us dependent on their agriculture. Both Christianity and Islam are bad for Africa as you can see,&rdquo; he said, adding, &ldquo;though I can tell you that Islam is worse in Africa because it respects no-one&rsquo;s way of life. This is why you can never catch me in a place like Saudi Arabia. Islam does not look kindly on people like my mother because the religion is detrimental to women generally. My mother was the first woman to drive a car in Nigeria&rsquo;s history and the first woman to wield the kind of power that single-handedly dethroned a king in African history. They (Islam) don&rsquo;t give women this type of power. But many of our African people go to Mecca every year to sell their conscience to a foreign religion and culture. They forget they are Africans first. We Africans had our culture and religions before the White man and Arabs came to our shores. We were the first people on this planet and we knew God before they did. Islam and Christianity are corrupting Africa and very soon we will be fighting bigger wars because of these foreign religions.&rdquo;</span></span>&nbsp;<span >&nbsp;With the Boko Harams, Al Shabbaz&rsquo;s and Ansar Dines, Fela has, to a large extent, been vindicated.
