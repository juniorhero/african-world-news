				&nbsp;</div>
			<div>
				<strong><strong>By Peter Uduehi</strong></strong></div>
			<div>
				<strong>To say that Nigeria is&nbsp;a divided country is an understatement. Ethnic and religious conflagrations have been raging since independence for varied reasons, some of them infantile or downright churlish.</strong></div>
			<div>
				Countless attempts have been made over many decades by&nbsp;rational political leaders to unite Nigerians around the&nbsp;notion of patriotism with&nbsp;very little success.&nbsp;There was the &ldquo;quota system&rdquo;,&nbsp;the National Youth&nbsp;Service&nbsp;(NYSC), the<img align="left" alt="" id="2e9bb6b5-2f15-479f-8ab6-23b7cf06748b" src="images/news/president_jonathan_9kvp.png" style="border-width:0px;border-style:solid;" />coveted &ldquo;federal character&rdquo;, thegovernment colleges run by the central government, and several other largesse-inducing programmes fashioned to give Nigerians a sense of nationhood so that ethnic and other divisions would be blurred&nbsp;almost to the&nbsp;point of atrophy. Former head-of-state Yakubu Gowon even coined a message out of his surname using its acronym for &ldquo;Go On With One Nigeria&rdquo;. Another artist made the first national anthem more didactic:&ldquo;though tongue and tribe may differ, we are all Nigerians&rdquo;.&nbsp;These fancycoinages and actions to foist oneness were definitely well-meaning but ethnic divisions are so deep in Africa they have become the equivalent of running a Mafia business. People swear by their tribe and become extra-sensitive&nbsp;when a member of their tribe is seen to be losing out in one contest&nbsp;or another.&nbsp;They quickly forget he&rsquo;s a human being ; opting to fan the embers&nbsp;of political pocketfires by claiming he had been wronged because he belonged to another tribe. Tribalism is a destructive malady, explains seasoned Nigerian journalist Peter Enahoro in his book &ldquo;The Complete Nigerian&rdquo;. He notes that a man has a name until he has donesomething wrong. If he does something you don&rsquo;t like, he automatically loses his name, Enahoro explains,&nbsp;adding the man would now be referenced by the&nbsp;tribe or ethnic group to which he belongs..&nbsp;That&rsquo;s what tribalism has produced in Nigeria and that is how scurrilous we have become in trying to build a nation-sense.</div>
			<div>
				It is why the recent election of President Goodluck Jonathan, considered the fairest poll held in Nigeria&rsquo;s history to date, cannot even be savoured by well-intentioned people as a new era in our polity for going from perennial destruction whenever an election is held to being an increasingly civilized citizenry, the most populous in Africa and most inhabited home to Blacks anywhere in the world. This short-lived euphoria punctuated by riots in Northern Nigeria is a revelation in itself; that Nigeria indeed has a long way to go in brotherly love. Since the announcement that Jonathan won the election, many&nbsp;houses have been burned and anyone whose home hung the placards of the ruling PDP or Jonathan is torched to death in Kano and Kaduna, two of the north&rsquo;s largest cities. The Red Cross says hundreds of innocent&nbsp;people have died as a result.</div>
			<div>
				And you only have to listen to the vehemence with which the detractors and violent protesters of the recent elections have been voicing their opposition to Jonathan&rsquo;s win. Radio, being what it is as the most effective wave in the ether in terms of allowing the flow of imagination, demonstrated the wicked affectation many Nigerians live within their nation-space.</div>
			<div>
				In a BBC radio interview conducted in Kano, a violent protester could be heard enunciating his dislike for&nbsp;Jonathan and southerners in a guttural vexation delivered in a crazed crescendo of embittered rage, his voice morbid and macabre and diabolical in its finality.&nbsp;Watching the same interview on television would not have created the same effect. I froze in my chair listening to this claptrap sounding as if his fellow Nigerian from the south is a citizen of another country. Truly, proponents of the splitting of Nigeria have often commented on the fact that the voice of that man on BBC to which we have referenced is typical of the feelings of the average northerner who sees southerners as aliens in their own country who must be treated&nbsp;differently. There are at least 400 ethnic groups in Nigeria though most have been carved into a cantankerous division of north and south. One wonders where this hatred comes from and when it will end. We have tried every attempt in the book to unite Nigerins, yet those who wish to introduce division invite both their religious and ethnic instincts to the table, sometimes engaging in destruction in the name of Allah, invoking uncanny incantations of a socalled Boko Haram malevolently casting aspersions on modernity to further the divide. In Nigeria if we don&rsquo;t modernize we will fall short of the glory of technology and continue to wallow in abject poverty. It is what the Muslim fanatics don&rsquo;t understand and it is what will eventually split the country. If that is what the north of Nigeria wants then the proponents of this outcome would have been emboldened.</div>
			<div>
				As it stands at the moment the runner-up in the last poll former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari, an extract from the catacombs with the blood of many innocent Nigerians on his hands, has yet&nbsp;to call to order his northern supporterswho are currently mangling other people&rsquo;s property and maiming lives. One important question these supporters have yet to answer is &ldquo;what is more significant for them, the man who wins an election, or the tribe of the man who wins an election?&rdquo; Does it really matter who wins an election? Many northerners, because they refuse to consider people of other faiths and ethnicity as vital, believe only a man of their background is fit to rule the country. Their mental state is especially rooted in Islamic fundamentalism which calls for a Jihad along the lines of Maitatsine, a Muslim one-name radical cleric (or Mohammed Marwa) who demented himself by playing God, plunged his acolytes and martyrdom into chaos and fell at the hands of the Nigerian police, joining his ancestors in 1980. So many northerners today think the only ideal situation is for a member of their ethnic division to forever rule the country because they don&rsquo;t believe in Nigeria and its vision of oneness; which suggests to us that a serious political reeducation of the country is perhaps the only way out of the morass we find ourselves.</div>
			<div>
				Many have suggested that if the north wants to go out of the union they should be allowed to do so, however, the unfortunate thing for these proponents is that most northerners, with all their clamour for hegemony, do not dare to use the &ldquo;C&rdquo; word (cessation), mainly because they don&rsquo;t have the resources to back themselves. All the resources are in the south. Which in itself makes all the vexation in that BBC interview demented.</div>

				<strong>News Analysis: Lessons from Ivory Coast</strong></div>
			<div>
				<strong>Gbagbo, Africa&rsquo;s leaders learning the hard way</strong></div>
			<div>
				<br />
				<strong>By Peter Uduehi</strong><br />
				<br />
				<div>
					If it&rsquo; s not Idi Amin today it&rsquo;s a Milton Obote tomorrow, or Mobutu Sese Seko, Goukouni Weddeye, Sani Abacha, Ibrahim Babangida, Hisen Habre, Mohammed Baglami, Ben Ali, Hosni Mubarak, Muammar Gadhafi, and of course Laurent Gbagbo; all of whom have a knack for quarrelling with detractors at the same time and having no sense of history to govern their compass in political matters.</div>
				<div>
					Look , for example, where stubbornness has landed the embattled Ivorian nuisance called Gbagbo. He has been cornered by a military machine on three fronts, former colonial ruler France, the United Nations and pro-Alasane Quattarra forces. Quattarra is believed by the international community to be the rightful winner of the recent poll in Ivory Coast contested against the incumbent Gbagbo. But the latter refuses to leave power because he says he&rsquo;s the real winner and that Quattarra had rigged the election as his forces alone controlled the north of the country held by rebels loyal to him.</div>
				<div>
					<br />
					Gbagbo may have a point, but should it take a prolonged argument to solve the real issues of bread and butter on the ground? How many arguments over decent matters should it take before we know that innocent people die through all the back and forth? Why fight the international community if it has decided on the way forward?</div>
				<div>
					<br />
					Since the elections that threw the country into chaos two months ago, more than two thousand people have lost their lives, according to the United Nations and many more may die before a substantive solution is reached in the Ivorian crisis. In Abidjan 330 people have died in the recent week of fighting especially since the French took sides in the battle to flush out Gbagbo. The United Nations has also joined in and Gbagbo looks engulfed from all sides. His downfall seems imminent and may end up like Samuel Doe of Liberia or Robert Gu&eacute;i who were killed horribly by their enemies. Guei, for instance, was buried nearly four years after his death while Doe was murdered like a chicken, limb by limb. Gbagbo was duly warned but like most African strongmen before him who felt power is the drug that lasts forever he has been engaging on forlorn hope that time will be kind to him. In a matter of a few weeks we will know his fate and would be a very sad one indeed.</div>
				<div>
					<br />
					Gbagbo would have to learn the hard way. It is so with Africa&rsquo;s shameless leaders who believe the post of the presidency belongs to members of their family. Babangida cajoled everyone in Nigeria until he played himself out of cards. He still roams the streets of the country after the spirits chased him from power, and today cannot show his face in public having been trounced in a bye-election by no less a swine in the person of Abubakar Atiku, a disastrous nonentity who tried to be something in Nigeria. Then there was the bestial Abacha who was a Babangida-wannabe parading himself like the real McCoy and openly berated himself in ignoramus ascension. He stole billions from the country&rsquo;s treasury and instructed the Central Bank Governor to wheel millions of dollars in bags to his residence. When the governor told him a nation is not run in that fashion he sacked him summarily.</div>
				<div>
					<br />
					In Ghana, leader after leader since Kofi Abrefa Busia in 1966 delivered the Black Star nation to hyenas who used their strong jaws to wreck anything of import in their way. Ghana descended into an unknown abyss and more than half of its citizens were forced to migrate to Nigeria. An army officer named J.J. Rawlings pretending to clean up the range stepped in and killed all those (including their families) considered to be the lynchpin of the country&rsquo;s Mafia always throwing the country into the Middle Ages&mdash;from Busia to Ignatius Achaempong. More than ten family patriarchs were shut in a firing squad. Some say Ghana&rsquo;s relative economic growth today can be linked to the ruthlessness meted out to Ghana&rsquo;s Mafia bosses who posed as legitimate power brokers and politicians.</div>
				<div>
					<br />
					In Uganda, the buffoon called Idi Amin became vile and vicious and was eventually banished to Saudi Arabia where he died in unfamiliar territory. Yoweri Museveni came and brought a semblance of order.</div>
				<div>
					<br />
					Fast-forward to 2011 where Ben Ali Mubarak of Tunisia and Egypt, respectively, failed to listen to the growing menace that crept around them. Both men also cajoled their baying populace until the latter could take it no more. Ben Ali attacked his country&rsquo;s coffers and made away with billions as did Mubarak said to have pilfered about 70 billion dollars stashed in foreign bank accounts. Both men were flushed from power in disgrace.</div>
				<div>
					<br />
					Just like apartheid&rsquo;s stalwarts thought they could outlast the entire world with their Augean stables of racism against African people. They too fell like a pack of cards with the Great Madiba Nelson Mandela invoking the spirit of forgiveness later as if to say, &ldquo;Forgive them Lord, for they know not what they were doing&rdquo;. They were conducting rubbish before a world reticent that their days were indeed numbered. The aforementioned actors of the catacombs should serve as examples to Gbagbo for his days are indeed numbered as well, and if history (which he has the benefit of hindsight) is any teacher he should borrow a leaf before he&rsquo;s put out like a hyena&rsquo;s prey, slaughtered without mercy. But we doubt if he has learned anything from history.</div>

			<strong>Which African countries&rsquo; mercenaries</strong></p>
		<p>
			<strong>are propping up Gadhafi?</strong></p>
		<p>
			Kenyan mercenaries are among foreign soldiers helping the besieged Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi fight off an uprising, says the Nairobi newspaper Daily Nation.</p>
		<p>
			The paper said reports have been confirmed by Col Gadhafi&#39;s former Chief of Protocol Nouri Al Misrahi in an interview with the Al Jazeera broadcasting network.</p>
		<p>
			Mr Misrahi was detailing how Gaddafi had resorted to using mercenaries against his own people after losing control of the Libyan armed forces.</p>
		<p>
			Asked how who have been recruited, the first country he mentioned was Kenya. Other countries he listed are Chad, Niger and Mali. The former Libyan chief said the mercenaries as jobless ex-soldiers and officers who were enticed to Libya by money. He clarified that they were not sent officially by their governments, but were privateers recruited directly by the regime and they were being used to hunt and kill Libyan dissidents after Gaddafi&#39;s armed police and soldiers abandoned him and &quot;went with the people&quot;.</p>
		<p>
			He said Gaddafi has no more trust in his own armed forces because they had largely defied orders to turn their guns on the demonstrators.</p>
		<p>
			&quot;Those mercenaries are being used against Libyans, because Gaddafi has no more trust in his police and soldiers, they let him down and went to the people&quot;.</p>
		<p>
			The mercenaries from African countries, he said, were poor and homeless former soldiers who were easily recruited over the years.</p>
		<p>
			Kenyan government says it is not aware of mercenaries from the country propping up the Gadhafi regime and that it is not Kenya&rsquo;s policy to come to the aid of the embattled tyrant. However, the government said it could not totally deny that some retired Kenyan officers have gone to Libya for the Gadhafi mission because it does not keep tabs on their whereabouts. The story of Kenyan mercenaries was lent further credence by a Libyan military defector quoted in the UK newspaper - The Guardian - listing Kenya as one of the recruitment grounds for thousands of African mercenaries propping up the regime. Air Force Major Rajib Feytouni said he had personally witnessed 4,000 to 5,000 mercenaries flown into his air force base on Libyan military transport planes since 14 February - several days before the uprising started, the Daily Nation is reporting. &quot;They (the planes) had 300 men at a time, all of them coming out with weapons. They were all from Africa: Ghanaians, Kenyans,&quot; he is quoted in the Guardian.</p>
		<p>
			The mercenaries are being used by Col Gaddafi to violently break down the wave of protests that is spreading across the North African country.</p>
		<p>
			&quot;That is why we turned against the government. That and the fact that there was an order to use planes to attack the people,&quot; said Major Feytouni in the second largest city of Benghazi which has fallen in the hands of rebels.</p>
		<p>
			Acting Foreign Affairs minister George Saitoti also denied the allegations when he appeared before the Parliamentary Committee on Defence yesterday. In Kenya&rsquo;s parliament, Richard Onyonka, a foreign affairs assistant minister dismissed the involvement of Kenyan mercenaries in the violent Libyan crackdown on protesters.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>&nbsp;Treason charges brought in Zimbabwe</strong></p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Amnesty International today expressed shock that at least 45 Zimbabwean activists have been charged with treason and could face the death penalty following their arrest at a lecture on the protests in North Africa.</p>
		<p>
			Mr Munyaradzi Gwisai, a former opposition parliamentarian, and 44 social justice, trade union and human rights activists were arrested by police on Saturday as they were attending a lecture entitled Revolt in Egypt and Tunisia. What lessons can be learnt by Zimbabwe and Africa.</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;This is a clear over-reaction by the state to an event in which the participants were exercising their legitimate right to freedom of expression which the government of Zimbabwe must guarantee under national and international law,&rdquo; said Michelle Kagari, Amnesty International&rsquo;s deputy director for Africa.</p>
		<p>
			Amnesty International is also alarmed by reports that at least seven of the activists, including Munyaradzi Gwisai, were beaten by security agents while in custody and called on the government to investigate the allegations.</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;The safety of detainees remains a serious concern as the Law and Order Section at Harare Central Police station has become notorious for the torture and ill-treatment of activists in their custody,&rdquo; said Michelle Kagari.</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;These persistent abuses demonstrate the need for urgent reform of Zimbabwe&rsquo;s security sector to bring to an end a culture of impunity for human rights violations and partisan enforcement of the law.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>
			Defence lawyers told Amnesty International they had been denied the opportunity to consult their clients and they were only informed of the charges facing the activists minutes before they were brought before the court.</p>
		<p>
			The proceedings were adjourned following protests from the lawyers and are expected to resume at a later date.</p>
		<p>
			Amnesty International is also concerned about reports that prison officers at the Magistrates court in Harare prevented the defence lawyers from taking instructions from their clients before they were transferred to Harare Remand Prison and Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison.</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;This restriction of the right of the activists to access their lawyer is unnecessary and throws serious doubts on the likelihood the detainees will receive a fair trial,&rdquo; said Michelle Kagari.</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;The police continue to selectively apply the law in favour of President Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s ZANU-PF party.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>
			Last month ZANU-PF supporters carried out attacks against opposition supporters in Harare&rsquo;s suburb of Mbare, but to date, the police have not arrested anyone.</p>
		<p>

		<p>
			<strong>Benin: IMF executive board</strong></p>
		<p>
			<strong>completes first review</strong></p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the first review of Benin&rsquo;s economic performance under a three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. The completion of the review enables the disbursement of SDR 10.61 million (about US$16.5 million), which would bring total disbursements under the program to SDR 21.23 million (about US$33 million).</p>
		<p>
			In completing the review, the Executive Board granted a waiver for nonobservance of the performance criterion relating to net domestic financing at end-June 2010 and approved an extension of the arrangement by three months. The three-year ECF arrangement for Benin was approved on June 14, 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/243) in an amount equivalent to SDR 74.28 million (about US$115.5 million).</p>
		<p>
			After the Executive Board&rsquo;s discussion of Benin, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;Amid unfavorable external and internal conditions, real GDP growth has been weaker than expected and performance under the program has been mixed. Revenue collection in the first half of 2010 fell below program targets, and the end-June performance criterion on net domestic financing was missed. These slippages were partially addressed with corrective actions in the second half of 2010. During the latter part of 2010, revenue collection efforts intensified, and expenditure was contained in line with available resources. Structural reforms proceeded, but with some delay.</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;In September and October 2010, Benin was hit by the worst flooding in 50 years, which caused a major humanitarian crisis. Preliminary estimates suggest that the floods caused considerable damage, particularly in agriculture, and will require substantial reconstruction in 2011.</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;The mixed economic performance in 2010 and the adverse shocks have led to a three-month extension of the program and to a revision of the program&rsquo;s macroeconomic framework and fiscal objectives. Real GDP growth is now projected to increase to 3.4 percent in 2011 and to improve gradually in the medium term. Achieving the revised objectives of the program will require a major effort to mobilize revenue and contain expenditure. The authorities intend to protect priority social spending, while containing current expenditure in line with reduced revenue expectations and revised deficit targets.</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;A timely implementation of the structural reform agenda will be essential to achieve the program objectives. Critical reforms include introduction of a one-stop window at the Port of Cotonou, full adoption of single taxpayer identification numbers, reform of the civil service, and a reform of the energy sector.&rdquo;</p>

			<strong>Botswana cuts ties with Libya</strong></p>
		<p>
			Botswana has severed diplomatic ties with Libya because of the growing unrest in the North African country which has led to brutal responses by the Muammar Gadhafi regime.</p>
		<p>
			A statement from the Botswana Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Gadhafi has been too high-handed against its citizens who are simply mounting unarmed peaceful protestations.</p>
		<p>
			The statement added that the move has been necessitated by the defiance and lack of remorse shown by embattled Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gadhafi.</p>
		<p>
			It said normal relations will only resume once Libya becomes politically stable.</p>
		<p>
			Botswana said it has nothing against the people of Libya and the break in diplomatic relations is targeted at the Libyan government. An enraged Gadhafi recently appeared on national TV and called for the execution of those behind the revolution threatening to kick him out of power.</p>
		<p>
			A day earlier, Botswana had summoned the Libyan ambassador in Gaborone to protest the bloody crackdown of the revolution. Botswana told the envoy that it continues to monitor what is happening in Libya and urged for restraint in dealing with the protestors.</p>
		<p>
			It said that as a peace-loving country, it is appalled by Gadhafi&#39;s response which projects total disregard for human life.</p>
		<p>
			Botswana said those responsible for killings in the Libyan crisis would one day be hauled before the International Criminal Court to &quot;account for their deeds&quot;.</p>
		<p>
			It has been at the forefront condemning the involvement of the military in the revolutions in Egypt and Libya warning African dictators that their time is up.</p>
		<p>
			&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Egypt: Ex-minister, state TV boss detained</strong></p>
		<p>
			Former information minister Anas al-Fikki and state TV boss Osama al-Sheikh have been detained by police for their involvement in graft as part of an ongoing probe of the Hosni Mubarak era.</p>
		<p>
			The move comes a day after three other officials appeared in court on charges of money laundering and abuse of power. Meanwhile, Egypt&#39;s new cabinet met for the first time, amid criticism that key Mubarak-era figures were not replaced.</p>
		<p>
			Opposition groups plan to rally on Friday to call for a new cabinet.</p>
		<p>
			They also want an end to the emergency law and for political prisoners to be freed.</p>
		<p>
			Last Friday, millions of Egyptians returned to Tahrir Square to celebrate the victory of their revolution, which led to the resignation of Mr Mubarak on 11 February after 18 days of street protests.</p>
		<p>
			They have vowed to keep up the pressure until their demands are met.</p>
		<p>
			Corruption probe</p>
		<p>
			On Thursday, ex-information minister Anas al-Fikki and former state radio and television chief Osama al-Sheikh were arrested as part of a probe into alleged graft.</p>
		<p>
			Mr Fikki is the fourth member of Mubarak&#39;s former government to be detained, after the former ministers of interior Habib al-Adly, tourism Zuhair Garana, and housing Ahmed al-Maghrabi.</p>
		<p>
			Recently, Mr Garana and Mr Maghrabi - along with steel tycoon and prominent ruling NDP party leader Ahmed Ezz - appeared in Cairo Criminal Court to face corruption charges.</p>
		<p>
			The men wore white prison uniforms and sat in a metal cage. An angry crowd of hundreds taunted them as they arrived in court, screaming &quot;thieves&quot; and &quot;you robbed our money&quot;, the AFP news agency reported.</p>
		<p>
			Atef Obeid, Egypt&#39;s prime minister from 1999-2004, and former culture minister Farouk Hosni have been banned from leaving the country pending further inquiries, along with several businessmen close to Mr Mubarak&#39;s regime.</p>
		<p>
			Egypt&#39;s top prosecutor earlier requested the freezing of the foreign assets of Hosni Mubarak himself, as well as his wife, his two sons and two daughters-in-law.</p>
		<p>
			All the officials say they are innocent.</p>
		<p>
			The crackdown comes as Egypt&#39;s new cabinet set to work, with security high on the agenda.</p>
		<p>
			The 10-member cabinet was sworn in by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, head of Egypt&#39;s military supreme council which is running the country until presidential and parliamentary elections later this year.</p>
		<p>
