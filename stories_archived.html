Augustus Oku</font></font></b><br />
<span style="font-size: small;"><font face="'Palatino Linotype', 'Book Antiqua', Palatino, serif"><b>By Peter Uduehi</b><br />
<br />
Noting that challenges abound for African immigrants &nbsp;in western
capitals, Reverend Augustus Oku of the&nbsp;<img alt="" width="226" height="520" align="right"  src="images/stories/rev_oku_pix_4i5y.png"  style="border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;" /> Presbyterian Church in Canada
says he&#8217;s on a mission to creating a significant and viable faith-based
community in Tooronto.<br />
Speaking to the African World, Rev. Oku said his new ministry the
Nigerian Presbyterian Mission in GTA, an arm of the Presbyterian Church
in Canada (PCIC), has identified the challenges new immigrants and
others face in a new society and he wants to be a conduit for properly
managing those confrontations.<br />
Rev. Oku himself has been appointed by the PCC to conduct its affairs to
Africans in the GTA. He said that his&nbsp; new ministry will conduct
counseling, bible studies, prophetic prayer sessions, healing and
deliverance and tarry nights (vigils) as part of its duties, stressing
that spiritual guidance in the format that Africans are familiar with in
their culture will be imbibed in the daily activities of the church.
They will include spiritualism, dancing and clapping of hands and
casting out of evil spirits&#8212;many of these bordering on Pentecostalism.<br />
Rev. Oku notes that&nbsp; the Pentecostal-like programmes of his new church
will not clash with the tenets of Presbyterianism, adding that &#8220;even a
reformed church must keep reforming&#8221;.&nbsp; Concurs the PCC&#8217;s general
secretary Life and Mission Agency Richard Fee. &#8220;We have different ethnic
groups in our ministry today compared to a hundred years ago when we
first came to Canada, and each community conducts its affairs within the
church based on its culture and tradition,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;It&#8217;s part of
who we are,&#8221; he said. Fee, who worked in Nigeria as a missionary for
many years, said&nbsp; the Canadian church has been in partnership with the
Nigerian church since 1954 and that Rev. Oku is well suited in his new
role as head of the Nigerian ministry in the GTA. &#8220;He has experienced
Canadian life and we knew he would hit the road running with the new
Nigerian Presbytery,&#8221; he said.<br />
Ron Wallace, associate secretary international of PCC, also noted the
great addition Rev. Oku would be to the PCC mission. He too stressed
that the PCC has come of age, widening, for example, the number of
languages its hymns are related.<br />
Rev. Oku is of the opinion that for him to succeed among Nigerians he
has to tackle some of those challenges, which he says include how to
stabilize African families in a new culture and creating awareness of
&#8220;fellowship.<br />
&#8220;I believe Africans need spiritual guidance in these matters even though
we always have to speak to the dynamics of our culture; particularly
the fact that we must not forget our culture in a new environment,&#8221; he
explained. He says it&#8217;s important for Africans to understand that it&#8217;s
more difficult to hold their families together in the Western world
compared to where they originally came from. Because of this, he said,
&#8220;the need for stronger fellowship among Africans abroad and in the
corporate world is paramount&#8221;, adding it&#8217;s the responsibility of the
clergy in the community to foster this vital element among immigrants.<br />
Rev. Oku heads the Presbytery among Nigerians in the GTA on the heels of
a growing number of African clergy heading to North America and Europe
in what many are calling &#8220;reverse evangelism&#8221;, that they are engaging in
the enterprise of selling Christianity to Europeans the same way the
latter did in Africa during and shortly after colonialism between 1864
and 1965.<br />
Commenting on this trend, Rev, Oku intimated that it&#8217;s important to put
things in perspective, noting that African evangelism in the West is
different. &#8220;Europeans came to Africa to colonise and condemn us while
Africans on the other hand are not colonizing the West in a political
and economic sense, and are surely not condemning Western culture. We as
African evangelists are simply preaching love and respect and true
fellowship in an African sense...that we should all be our brother&#8217;s
keeper as the Bible urges,&#8221; he explained. He said there were many&nbsp;
dangers inherent in European condemnation of African culture as they
tried to evangelise on the continent. One of them was that they
alienated the people they preached to, &#8220;instead of telling Africans that
their traditional religious practices of libation and idol or
animal-sacrificial worshipping were in fact consistent with certain
practices in Christendom; for example, that while Christ was considered a
&#8216;lamb without blemish&#8217;, he (Christ) was the bigger and better sacrifice
(not the ones African religions held in high esteem).&#8221;<br />
Another case in point, he said, is the condemnation of the way Africans
invoke the spirits of the dead or their ancestors. He said European
evangelists then should have reminded Africans that the concept was in
order as Christians today inculcate on the &#8216;communion of the Saints&#8217;.<br />
&#8220;So we have repackaged Christianity and are bringing it back to this
part of the world to tell a complete story of Christ; that he stood for
love, fellowship, and every anti-racial element,&#8221; Rev. Oku said.

<font style="font-size: 32px;">Case dropped against former IMF boss after Guinean woman's accusations found wanting</font><br />
By Peter Uduehi</b></div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">The case against former IMF chief
Dominique Strauss-Kahn seems to have fallen apart and has led a U.S.
judge to release him from house arrest and had his $6m cash bail and
bond returned.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">Prosecutors say Strauss-Kahn should be freed "on his own recognisance," meaning he must simply promise to appear in court.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">he
former IMF boss is accused of sexually assaulting Nafissiatu Diallo, a
Guinean (West African) hotel maid in New<img alt="" width="200" height="102" align="right"  src="images/stories/nafissiatu_diallo.jpg"  style="border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;" /> York in May, but the case is
reported to be collapsing as the veracity of his accuser is now in
doubt.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">Apart from what some say is an
unbelievable tale that the 62-year-old Strauss-Khan is agile enough to
chase the younger maid in the hotel hallway, force down her panties and
make her perform oral sex, the Guinean has also recanted her earlier
claim that she was raped while in her home country of Guinea before <img alt="" width="163" height="309" align="left"  src="images/stories/dominique_strauss-khan.jpg"  style="border-width: 0pt; border-style: solid;" />she
entered the United States - where her asylum application papers with
the U.S. Immigration points to that fact. This makes her a liar and has
brought her credibility into serious question.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">Also questioned by many in France,
where he's a leading candidate against Nikoli Sarkozy for the French
presidency next year, is the fact that Strauss-Khan was set-up for
disgrace and his chances ruoned by those loyal to Sarkozy, if not the
French president himself. The former IMF boss has said previously that
one factor counting against him as a politician is that he's Jewish.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">Strauss-Khan will appear in a New York
court again July 18 and even though he has been released cannot leave
the U.S. until the matter is legally over for him.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">"I want to remind all of you that at
each appearance in the last six weeks, we asked you and asked the world
not to rush to judgement - now I think you can understand why," said Mr
Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, William Taylor, after leaving the courtroom.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">"We believe the next step will lead to the complete dismissal of the charges," he added.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">"I understand that the circumstances
of this case have changed substantially and I agree the risk that he
would not be here has receded quite a bit. I release Mr Strauss-Kahn at
his own recognisance," Justice Michael Obus told the court.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">In earlier court hearings, prosecutors
had spoken of the strength of their case. One attorney said the proof
against him was "substantial".</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">After the recent hearing, the alleged
victim's lawyer, Kenneth P Thomson, maintained that his client's story
was genuine and that Mr Strauss-Kahn was guilty of sexual assault
charges.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">"The only defence Dominique Strauss-Kahn has is that this sexual encounter was consensual. That it a lie," he said.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">However, law enforcement officials have now told US media the accuser has repeatedly lied since the alleged attack on 14 May.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">But Mr Thompson defended his client's
story on Friday, offering up graphic details of the alleged encounter
between Mr Strauss-Kahn and the maid.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">"From day one she has described a
violent sexual assault that Dominique Strauss-Kahn committed against
her," Mr Thompson said, adding that Mr Strauss-Kahn bruised the maid's
body and threw her to the floor.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">"She has never once changed a single thing about that account. The district attorney knows that," he added.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">Mr Thompson said that though the maid "may have made some mistakes", that does not mean the rape never occurred.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">Mr Strauss-Kahn has been under house arrest in a New York apartment since posting a $6m cash bail and bond in May.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">He is charged with seven counts
including four more serious felony charges - two of criminal sexual
acts, one of attempted rape and one of sexual abuse - plus three
misdemeanour offences, including unlawful imprisonment.</div>
<div style="font-weight: normal;">Mr Strauss-Kahn, who resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund to defend himself, vigorously denies the charges.</div>

The Libyans, fleeing their homeland, had wrongly accusedthe Ghanaians of been part of Col. Muammar Gadhafi's borrowed army or mercenaries deployed into Libya to quell the unrest currently brewing in the North African country. In the early days of the protests against the Gadhafi regime many Libyans told foreign reporters that they saw Black Africans, mainly from Chad, Niger and Sudan, shooting at them&nbsp;<img alt="" width="512" height="300" align="right" src="images/stories/migrant_workers_stranded_hcx1.jpg"   style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid;" />as the unrest raged throughout the country. Some reports have claimed that Col. Gadhafi had paid up to $100 million to the Chadian government to send troops to prop up his regime. Other reports within Africa say that retired servicemen from Kenya, Niger, Chad, Zimbabwe and Tanzania have been part of the mercenary force rushed into Libaya to save the Gadhafi embattled regime.</font></span></div>

<div style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 12px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; text-align: left;"><font face="georgia, serif">Blacks and were reminded of the people sent into Libya by Gadhafi and they allowed their emotions, coupled with their displacement to get the better of them. That was what I think happened," Martins said. He said the whole matter has been cleared up now and that the United Nations camp set up for the migrants is calm. Many of the Black migrants (who come from other African countries) in the camp have themselves been living in Libya until the current unrest.&nbsp;<br />

stress it&#8217;s the most fair and free election &nbsp;to date in Nigeria&#8217;s

embittered rage. It&#8217;s the kind of rage that makes one ask the question:
where does this type of anger from a fellow citizen come from? What&#8217;s
the genesis of this type of rage? And at what price should Nigerians
demand their freedom from this sordid affair every four years? Two
National Youth Service Corps volunteers in the North, southerners who
have no axe to grind other than how better their country should be run,
were mercilessly killed by the baying protesters &nbsp;and churches burned by

2000 the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) predicted that
Nigeria, by 2015, will implode and eventually be divided along the lines
of Sudan (which has just happened) because of the multiplicity of the
internal contradictions embroiling the country. Principal among these
dividing fractures is religion, with the south mainly Christian and the
north mainly Muslim. It is complicated by ethnic divisions pervasive in
both regions so much so that the ruling PDP has designed a rotational
presidency among its ranks in the six political zones in &nbsp;the country.
As much as some people would like to see a united Nigeria, many people
think the CIA predictions may come to pass after all, considering the
perennial violence following elections in Nigeria.</font></div>

Cameroon: Journalist Nkamtchuen charged</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-US" style="font-size: 11pt;"><b>By Peter Uduehi<o:p></o:p></b></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"><span lang="en-US" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia;">Cameroonian journalist Raphael Nkamtchuen's recent arrest by state security services is raising concern in many quarters, including the The Committee to Protect Journalists who has demanded answers from the Paul Biya regime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"><span lang="en-US" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia;">&nbsp;The organisation along with local journalists fear Nkamtchuen's arrest is an indication that the government has not ceased harassing journalists who are essential as watchdogs in Cameroon's corruption-ridden society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"><span lang="en-US" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia;">A&nbsp;public prosecutor is charging the journalist, editor of the periodical La Boussole with "unauthorized communication with a detainee" and "possession of administrative documents labeled 'confidential". &nbsp;The charges are based on an October 27, 2009, letter that allegedly leaked from the office of top presidential adviser Laurent Esso. Guards found the letter on Nkamtchuen as he left Yaound&#233;'s Kondengui Prison following an interview with jailed former Finance Minister Polycarpe Abah Abah on February 17. Nkamtchuen told authorities the letter was leaked to him and that he carried it into the prison.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"><span lang="en-US" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia;">The vice premier for justice Amadou Ali&nbsp;is said to have been informed in the alleged letter from Esso that president Biya had already approved his proposal to arrest a number of public officials for corruption, including&nbsp;Abah Abah, who was convicted of graft through Operation Sparrohawk, an anti-corruption regime of the government.&nbsp;Esso has not publicly reacted to the allegations, according to local journalists.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"><span lang="en-US" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia;">Nkamtchuen, was detained for six days by Cameroon's military police before he was charged. He was free pending trial on March 24, but according to reports has gone into hiding after receiving threatening phone calls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"><span lang="en-US" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia;">"We are concerned for the safety of Rapha&#235;l Nkamtchuen, who has gone into hiding after being charged in connection to his investigation into possible government abuse of power," said CPJ (Committee to Protect Journalists) Africa Advocacy Coordinator Mohamed Keita. "We hold the government responsible for his safety and well-being."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"><span lang="en-US" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia;">Nkamtchuen is disputing all the charges against him saying it was the third time he had visited Abah Abah in Kondengui Prison and that prison guards had never required any special authorization to communicate with a detainee previously, he reportedly told CPJ. However, a prison guard was arrested on charges of conspiring to facilitate his entry, he said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-weight: normal;"><span lang="en-US" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: georgia;">Recently, Esso ordered the arrests of four journalists after another document purported to have been leaked from his office detailing a kickbacks scheme surfaced, according to CPJ research. The arrests lead to the death in custody of one of the journalists, Germain Cyrille Ngota.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
