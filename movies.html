<div><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">Nigerian Movies: Some hard truths!</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><strong>By Peter Uduehi</strong></span></p>
<div><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"> One must applaud the sheer imagination of the Nigerian youth and the cinema industry for having the audacity over two decades to tell an African story through the screen in ways never before told by Africans themselves.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"> We say this because for far too long Africans have been inundated with cinemas from abroad particularly India and the United States. But thanks to Nollywood, Nigeria&rsquo;s movie platform, fewer and fewer films from foreign lands are making their cultural impact upon our lives. It&rsquo;s a good thing, if not for the boost it gives to Nigeria&rsquo;s GDP. And today other nations in Africa are following the Nigerian example and plunging into &nbsp;what was hitherto the preserve of Hollywood and Bollywood.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"> Estimates show that the Nigerian cinema is advancing by leaps and &nbsp;bounds and we must commend the producers and actors and bankrollers for their esteemed effort. That the Nigerian cinema is considered by most serious people as the second-largest in the world is an attestation to their hard work. But like most things or industries growth and sophistication are significant factors on the way to becoming top-notch in a world full of surprises and competition.</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"> The Nigerian film industry must grow and become smart and sophisticated, but how it does that is what this column will deal upon, as there are many areas in the industry that need important overhauling. First, watching the average Nigerian movie can be nightmarish for someone whose ears have been trained to manage certain levels of sound decibles in a culture where noise pollution is not condoned. The tonality of voice-overs introducing a movie and other upcoming ones on the screen often employ screeching voice deliveries that are completely unnecessary. Instead of use alluring, more &nbsp;inductive &nbsp;(or even near-seductive) voices, it&rsquo;s announcers deliver in high pitched, sometimes cacophonous, and jarring and frightening voice-overs &nbsp;that are universally anathema. There&rsquo;s no gentility in coming across as if to portray the average African as manic and forceful..</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"> &nbsp;The actors are no better. Once brilliant and &nbsp; natural actors like Nonsu Diobi become less didactic &nbsp;as they have descended into shrilling intonations to point a point across on the screen. A low-key almost non-verbal remark can still be effective, but it all depends on the producer&rsquo;s deftness. Many of them are not. Sylvester Obadigie, for example, should have had his actors and actresses less sonorous in many films this space is too small to recant.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"> The same goes for the other producers and directors who constantly bedevil their audiences with inferior productionship. There are indeed some movies that give you the feeling of clever scripting and mature production from the outset, but fail woefully toward the end because their directors have not been consistent with maintaining cordiality and maturity in discourse and dialogue between the actors. A case in point is Empty Coffin which features Zack Orji delivering a tour de force acting at the beginning and other protagonists made to exude unnecessary loudness of tone, negating the work of an interrogating police detective. These are areas directors and producers of the Nigerian cinema must try their level best to improve upon if their films are to gain more international appeal</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span>In other news,</span>&nbsp;veteran Nollywood&nbsp;actor <strong><span>Ashley Nwosu</span></strong> has died A military hospital in Yaba, Lagos has reported the death of veteran Nigerian actor Ashley Nwosu. Reports say the actor died after hours after he fell into a coma. The respected actor from Abia State was 55 and had been a steady diet on many Nollywood films playing roles speaking mainly to roots and culture.&nbsp; Nollywood and the African movie industry were immediately thrown into a state of mourning with several movie greats expressing shock and grief at his</span><img src="images/movies/1.jpg" alt="" width="280" height="296" align="left" /><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif;"> passing.Notable among them was the National President of the Actors&rsquo; Guild of Nigeria, Segun Arinze who said Ashley Nwosu's death was a great loss to Nollywood and Nigeria.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have lost yet another fantastic actor. We are going to miss him definitely, because he represented a bundle of talent. It is a rather unfortunate incident. Aside Nollywood, the entire nation will also miss him,&rdquo; Arinze said.&nbsp; He has starred in countless number of movies including; Endless Night, Between Two Walls, Power Brokers, Foreign Affairs, Gift from the Grave, Lagos Babes and Ghetto Love.</span></div>
